# Cryptocurrencies Data Explorer

The Cryptocurrencies Data Explorer is a web application built using React and Redux that allows users to explore Cryptocurrencies data related to a variety of categories. The webapp retrieves data from the a coins API to gather datasuch as cryptocurrency exchanges.

Upon loading the homepage, the user is presented with a list of different currencies, which they can filter by currency name.When the user clicks on a Currency, they are taken to a details page, which retrieves detailed data from the API in the selected Coin.

The application is built using React, Redux, and CSS. It utilizes the Redux Thunk middleware to handle asynchronous actions and the Fetch API to retrieve data from the NAPI. The application is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.
